Subject: Apology Regarding Our Nuit de l’Info Submission

Dear Nuit de l’Info Team,

We would like to sincerely apologize for the issue with uploading the vertical pre-submission file. Unfortunately, we were unable to upload it in advance because the file size exceeded the limits (around 500 MB). Despite this, we followed all the required guidelines and used an open-source project that we modified according to the specifications and rules of the vertical project.

We also purchased the domain name pacosder.sit and a shared hosting plan in order to deploy the vertical version of our project. However, due to hosting limitations, we were unable to upload the large file successfully. Below, we are providing sample videos demonstrating the project, along with details about the hosting problem we encountered.

We, PS CODERS, sincerely apologize for this inconvenience and the technical difficulties. We were also surprised by this issue and did our best to overcome it, but the file size restriction prevented us from completing the upload.

Thank you for your understanding, and we appreciate your time and consideration.

Kind regards,
PS CODERS Team
