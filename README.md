Subject: Apology Regarding Our Nuit de l’Info Submission


Dear Nuit de l’Info Team,

We would like to express our sincere apologies regarding the issue with uploading the vertical pre-submission file. Unfortunately, we were not able to upload it in advance because the file size was extremely large (around 500 MB), which exceeded the available upload limits. Despite this, we fully followed all required rules and guidelines.

Our team built the project using Chamilo (https://chamilo.org/en/), a fully open-source and complete platform. We modified it extensively to match all the technical requirements and constraints of the challenge. We completely redesigned the visual appearance, edited more than 10,000 existing code files, and added more than 10,000 new files. We also integrated many new features through plugins in order to meet the full specifications of the vertical project.

We also purchased the domain name pacosder.sit and a shared hosting plan to deploy our vertical version. However, due to technical limitations from the hosting provider, we were unable to upload such a large file, despite multiple attempts. For this reason, we have included video samples demonstrating the full project, along with details explaining the hosting issue we encountered.

We, PS CODERS, sincerely apologize for this inconvenience. We invested significant effort and were surprised by this technical problem. We tried every possible solution, but the oversized file remained the main obstacle.
